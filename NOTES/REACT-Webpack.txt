react supports one way binding

webpack:

webpack is a process of creating a front end bundle which contains all HTML, CSS and JS files which is compiled and bundled with the library. In the webpack, only the components will be added and the rest will be eliminated. Hence, only necessary library will be added and the size of the webpack will be less after compilation

In order to create a webpack, we need compilers and webpage config file.

As discussed earlier, the compiler we use for js to compile is babel compiler

to install babel compiler:

 npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react babel-loader css-loader sass sass-loader webpack webpack-cli
